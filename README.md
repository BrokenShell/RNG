## RNG Specifications

#### Random Boolean
- `RNG.bernoulli_variate(ratio_of_truth: float) -> bool`
    - Produces a Bernoulli distribution of boolean values.
    - @param ratio_of_truth :: the probability of True. Expected input range: `[0.0, 1.0]`, clamped.
    - @return :: True or False


#### Random Integer
- `RNG.uniform_int_variate(left_limit: int, right_limit: int) -> int`
    - Flat uniform distribution.
    - @param left_limit :: input A.
    - @param right_limit :: input B. 
    - @return :: random integer in the inclusive range `[A, B]` or `[B, A]` if B < A
- `RNG.binomial_variate(number_of_trials: int, probability: float) -> int`
    - Based on the idea of flipping a coin and counting how many heads come up after some number of flips.
    - @param number_of_trials :: how many times to flip a coin.
    - @param probability :: how likely heads will be flipped. 0.5 is a fair coin. 1.0 is a double headed coin.
    - @return :: count of how many heads came up.
- `RNG.negative_binomial_variate(trial_successes: int, probability: float) -> int`
    - Based on the idea of flipping a coin as long as it takes to succeed.
    - @param trial_successes :: the required number of heads flipped to succeed.
    - @param probability :: how likely heads will be flipped. 0.50 is a fair coin.
    - @return :: the count of how many tails came up before the required number of heads.
- `RNG.geometric_variate(probability: float) -> int`
    - Same as random_negative_binomial(1, probability). 
- `RNG.poisson_variate(mean: float) -> int`
    - @param mean :: sets the average output of the function.
    - @return :: random integer, poisson distribution centered on the mean.


#### Random Floating Point
- `RNG.generate_canonical() -> float`
    - Evenly distributes floats of maximum precision.
    - @return :: random float in range (0.0, 1.0)
- `RNG.uniform_real_variate(left_limit: float, right_limit: float) -> float`
    - Flat uniform distribution of floats.
    - @return :: random Float between left_limit and right_limit.
- `RNG.normal_variate(mean: float, std_dev: float) -> float`
    - @param mean :: sets the average output of the function.
    - @param std_dev :: standard deviation. Specifies spread of data from the mean.
- `RNG.lognormal_variate(log_mean: float, log_deviation: float) -> float`
    - @param log_mean :: sets the log of the mean of the function.
    - @param log_deviation :: log of the standard deviation. Specifies spread of data from the mean.
- `RNG.exponential_variate(lambda_rate: float) -> float`
    - Produces random non-negative floating-point values, distributed according to probability density function.
    - @param lambda_rate :: λ constant rate of a random event per unit of time/distance.
    - @return :: The time/distance until the next random event. For example, this distribution describes the time between the clicks of a Geiger counter or the distance between point mutations in a DNA strand.
- `RNG.gamma_variate(shape: float, scale: float) -> float`
    - Generalization of the exponential distribution.
    - Produces random positive floating-point values, distributed according to probability density function.    
    - @param shape :: α the number of independent exponentially distributed random variables.
    - @param scale :: β the scale factor or the mean of each of the distributed random variables.
    - @return :: the sum of α independent exponentially distributed random variables, each of which has a mean of β.
- `RNG.weibull_variate(shape: float, scale: float) -> float`
    - Generalization of the exponential distribution.
    - Similar to the gamma distribution but uses a closed form distribution function.
    - Popular in reliability and survival analysis.
- `RNG.extreme_value_variate(location: float, scale: float) -> float`
    - Based on Extreme Value Theory. 
    - Used for statistical models of the magnitude of earthquakes and volcanoes.
- `RNG.chi_squared_variate(degrees_of_freedom: float) -> float`
    - Used with the Chi Squared Test and Null Hypotheses to test if sample data fits an expected distribution.
- `RNG.cauchy_variate(location: float, scale: float) -> float`
    - @param location :: It specifies the location of the peak. The default value is 0.0.
    - @param scale :: It represents the half-width at half-maximum. The default value is 1.0.
    - @return :: Continuous Distribution.
- `RNG.fisher_f_variate(degrees_of_freedom_1: float, degrees_of_freedom_2: float) -> float`
    - F distributions often arise when comparing ratios of variances.
- `RNG.student_t_variate(degrees_of_freedom: float) -> float`
    - T distribution. Same as a normal distribution except it uses the sample standard deviation rather than the population standard deviation.
    - As degrees_of_freedom goes to infinity it converges with the normal distribution.
